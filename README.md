# Code Review

Code review written by [Alice Nyberg](https://github.com/alicenyberg).

1. `index.php:4` - You may want to have the opening body-tag in your header.php, easier if you later want to add an about-page for example.
2. `index.php:5` - You could have had your header and nav-tag in your header.php.
3. `index.php:5` - The nav-bar in your header is not linked to any other pages.
4. `index.php:15` - Consider having only one h1 instead of two.
5. `TIP` - Your font of choice is a bit hard to read sometimes, for example the directions under the ingredients.
